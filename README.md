A short essay on self and association; Americentric. 

## A Little Bit On The Cultural Self and Association  
## written by Richard Pham  

The self, you and I would say to each other, is based around the individual, 
that is, you and I are discrete entities. But during dialogue, the sentiment
might be unifying enough for the shared vision. From the vision is there, the 
path, in a sea of many choices. To alter or derail this path is unseemly, yes, 
according to the planners. And the planners are learned ones, well... at least 
learned enough to lead. 

The vision of consensus is also deficit towards oneness that would be even more 
ridiculous otherwise, in many cases. In many cases, there are these prefixes 
to think on: auto, homo, and mono. In each of these senses of identity (there 
can be no oneness without), there is affinity for the similar that would not 
be fully detected as difference across the metrological spectrum. Differences 
in recognition can spring from the mind; the cause of errors is this, but that 
does not explain the cause of the object being labelled erroneous. An important 
concept, very much present and furthermore, provable through scientific measures, 
is "natural proximity". The familial way of rule becomes the most frequently 
officious unit of organization. An arguable statement, especially in juxtaposition 
to other units revolving around faith and secular political organization. One 
theory goes as such: the development of a human being in their years formative 
of ideological adherence and physical growth (both of these are assumed to cease 
after some predictable age, in normative cases), and the support system is directed 
through familial channels, hence why family has come to take precedence as primary 
markers of identification, especially those emphatic on genealogy despite associated 
faith. The state that connects, guides, and organizes people is the base of 
collectivist ideology. Elevating the state over family carries certain ramifications: 
the support system becomes more multi-sourced in argument of even distribution, but 
so is the feedback process of contribution. Democratization is a body of processes 
that always seems to run into genealogical and ethno-cultural issues in preference. 
There is a lot of display, despite questions on integrity and ethics, due to 
democratization processes. 

On this last statement, I always arrive at the question, instead of any solution 
not from and for the minisculinity of specifics, of the "genuine" quality of this 
distribution, in blanket form, that will always elicit sentiments of their goodness, 
based on their gifting usually in material form that was intended to serve as proof, 
in-and-of the objects. And the labelling of morality is established as connection 
between giver (the ruling administrators), the "source" really, and object/s to be gifted. 
Note that the questioning of quality for genuine fit is a stall on proceedings, wanted 
from the person (the giver), in cases of "business as usual". The reasoning here serves 
as explanation for highly critical treatments of scientist types (moreso than the 
systematic engineers who become so hesitant for improvement of systems that clearly 
demand protection and utility a great deal more than improvement, improvement which does not work 
under the axiomatic fruition). Scientist types that enter the social playing field 
are initially disadvantaged, in comparison to the social types, many of whom exude 
confidence in manipulating social matters, such manipulation only possible if they 
are fixed enough in designated roles. This observation is based on the numbers at 
play, important enough at play to be the deciding initiator in matters of influencing 
human choice if not also will. 

By far, this perspective is the most suitable to pyramidal hierarchies. And the 
geometry of pyramids has come to serve as the primitive ideal of republicanism. The 
limiting of state, as uniformity of distribution and circulation while never-minding 
the source, and the elevation of leaders to figurehead representatives of states comprise 
the polar elements of whole structure. Holistically, republicanism spread across territory 
has qualities of differences easier to exploit via precision-based malnetworking. 
Standing in contrast to this state (it is more than just for show and title, for the 
human experience is embedded in these forms implemented from said style) is democratization, a 
facelessization process. Weakness of this is the collective inability, despite 
consensus on matters usually not very far from the base. Western capitalists will 
state this is the wrong approach to caring, for it may be a caring genuine and blind, but 
it leaves people very bonded sheerly because of dependency. Indian capitalists are thus, 
curious cases. Their possessions are a potent tool for the vast number of Indian societies 
expected to behave and aspire towards codified framework. The "tool for" turns into a 
miser's withholdings from the populace. When natural disasters hit, the powerless 
suffer out of their blanket conformity to limitations set by enumeration. Famine is 
the big one, even though it is not an outright killer. On a related note, the Medicis 
were viewed as benevolent despots, based on premises such as the previous statement. 

The concept of "brain capital" is very much objectivist and also, intricately coupled 
with Western policy. Industrialization has produced this model of developing brain capital: 
the mass gatherings, similar to attending Catholic Church mass, by universities is the 
input for the mind and soul. And the output is the consequences from the knowledges and 
messagings of those input nodes. Here is where arbitrating lines are drawn. The knowledgeable 
and/or faithful come to play roles in political design, style, and execution. Majoritarian 
traits are the backbone, despite inabilities similar to those produced from over-democratization. 
Control is about the ends, and policies concerning "brain capital" tend to lean on the 
extractive/minoritive source-agnostic end of utility. This factesque conclusion, when 
acknowledged, must be somewhat unsettling to valuators of material. Simple implementation 
corresponds the human beings to their knowledge and capability. This implementation 
is indeed fatalist. 

Presently, in the decade since 2016 (when mass industrialization of data mining came to be), 
the A.I. "industry" is much more loosely connected, much more questionable because it is 
no longer about the infrastructure or the verifiability of correctness. From the whims 
and passions and ideology, this from the human mind, these causes prone the task of A.I. development 
to scattering and poisoning, in the informatic sense. Cultural accommodations in 
the development of artificial intelligence is, in its primal state , to convenience 
intelligence-gathering, first and foremost. Development and distribution are 2nd classes 
of actions. Just think... A.I. could really be all about manipulating your perception 
and changing your judgments. That works quite well for the "political machine" style 
of democratic rule. And that would be the end of that promise. The leadership..., 
clearly of nature tied to politics in terms of hierarchy (some may confuse the two 
terms with one another, but I clarify that politics can be more rapid in initiation and 
reaction than hierarchy without guaranteeing you any hope), takes precedence for the values 
agreed upon. 

A glaringly obvious problem with the globalist approach to A.I. development rests on 
compatibilities with Old World hierarchies. A China man would have to cross the 
Muslim-dominated  Middle East, the democratic kingdoms of the Jewish people, gypsies and 
other companies (mainly indigenous) to be able to be on par with the predominant 
Anglo-Germanic American establishment. This should not be interpreted as a geography problem: 
there is the alternative of crossing the Pacific Ocean, where evidence of effects is of 
much more commerce than anything else. Cultural stubbornness is only part of the problem: 
never mind the democratic synthesizers that spill ruins of duplicity as contagiously as 
statist policy allows them. This description I have just given is an Americentric problem. 
Note how I used the "American" term as base instead of USA. America has a Columbian connotation 
(expansioniista), and I would also say it is usually associated with the mores of citizens with 
cultural backgrounds from the southern half of Western Europe. 

The topic of "hacking" also plays a crucial part in discussions of the self and 
association. Republicanism has traditionally suffered and continues to suffer from 
scientific rigor. The case I am making is based on the directionality of application: 
the Three Kingdoms Problem is expected to follow patterns of exclusive application of the 
"positive" inward from scientific products, limited and controlled commerce between the kingdoms, 
and "negative" application outward in cases of perceived malice from one kingdom to another. Hacking 
systems is truthfully only as scientifically impressive as success in solving search problems (vulnerabilities), 
nevermind the spirit of mores and alliances in exploitation past the finished search. Republican 
logic suffers from an arts problem, when fundamentals are withheld while variants, with same 
purpose and different target, are pushed and pulled. The impression is the initiative to 
act in the direction of obfuscation and dismantlement. Consider this case: a spammer and a 
scammer are under suspicion for cyber-crimes, but darknet technologies confuse observers of 
the two. The hacking that takes place to determine each one from the two is not scientific but 
procedural. Typical procedure involves subpoena for backdoors and background investigations. 
The "science" here is best argued to be such by social scientists. Humanists go the contrary 
route of Machiavelli, a figure that seems to have professed his labor into the heat of his era's 
factional politics. 

At the end of the day, chimera is unoriginal multi-sourced; this logic is not the best, but that 
is logic for you.
